**Known Issues**
- Quickly/Repeatedly opening tunnels can accumulate descriptors faster than they are released
- Quickly/Repeatedly calling a dispatcher on windows, can cause the service to crash/restart if an overlapping dispatcher is created without cleaning up the existing instance.
- Garbage Collection (Finalization) of some objects can be delayed when there is a circular loop in the referencing. These objects only get finalized with a mark-and-sweep. The biggest culprit is anonymous functions, where the runtime automatically will reference locally scoped objects by the anonymous function object
- Not all the code-paths in meshcore.js has been analyzed so it is possible that some agent functions may still leak memory
